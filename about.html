    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>Why did I build this? I came up with the idea, driving on the highway on my way back home last week. For those that doesn't know, NYC highways are terrible. There is potholes everywhere. I was driving 70MPH trying to dodge the potholes in Long Island, NY. This inspire me to build the game.</p>

  <main>
    <div id="dodge1">
      <h3>Retro dodge built</h3>
      <h5>Planing out</h5>
      <p>create a game with a car dodging potholes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I did research on similar games. such as traffic racer.</li>
        <li>base on Traffic racer listed out components for the game</li>
        <li>plan out files require for the game, eg. html, css, js, and img</li>
        <li>research js function formula for the game.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>grid movements</li>
            <li>event control</li>
            <li>collision check</li>
            <li>game reset</li>
            <li>timing events</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, it was a great experience building the game. My first version of the game's movement are very jaggy, and it looks retro. So I name the game retro.</p>

    <div id="dodge2">
      <h3>Dodge 2 built</h3>
      <h5>Planing out</h5>
      <p>create a smoother animated version of retro dodge</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reviewed class and objecst on js for this.</li>
        <li>previous researched on requestAnimationFrame, really want to use it on this game</li>
        <li>researched and learned HTML canvas for the game</li>
        <li>use more advance collision check</li>
        <li>smooth animation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, I'm happy with what i wanted to do for this game, the animation is smooth.</p>
